The user interacts with the app by clicking on number buttons to input numbers, and operator buttons to perform operations. The input and result are displayed on a TextView. The app also contains an onEqual function to perform the calculation and display the result when the equal button is clicked. It also has an onClear function to clear the TextView when the clear button is clicked. The app uses some additional functionality like checking for a decimal point and checking if an operator has already been added to the input.![readmeScreenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117454427/215279971-bf9e8dd6-f19e-40a2-96e0-2f5abd249399.png)
